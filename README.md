Neighborhood Chef provides a uniquely intimate approach to social culinary gatherings, allowing for both the creation and attending of culinary events in your neighborhood.

### Key Features

- Culinary event creation
- join/RSVP open events

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

- embraces javascript-based programming
- interacts with DOM via JSX
- supports immutability that Redux enforces

#### Redux

- provides immutability in state management for reliability
- allows for scalability of application
- provides a structured workflow of state management

#### Okta API

- service for the storing and authentication of user accounts
- provides improved layers of security with a multifactor PCKE authorization flow and secure methods of authenticating a user after log in (via introspection requests)
 

#### Front end deployed using AWS Amplify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/neighborhood-chef-be) built using:

#### NodeJS/ExpressJS

- embraces javascript-based programming
- when grouped with basic middlewares (Helmet, CORS, Compression, Multer, JSON), provides robust server structure
- easily scalable

#### GraphQL Query language

- simple, easy to read queries and data retrieval
- very efficient queries
- predictable in what will be provided

#### PostgreSQL Database

- fully capable and diverse with many different index types
- open source source code for visibility
- allows full support for SSL and other security measures
- atomic and consistent

#### Back end deployed using AWS Amplify

# APIs

## Okta Authentication API

  Robust and trusted authentication platform that is easily integrated into React front end as well as NodeJS backend frameworks

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. Please refer to the .env.example file contained within the src folder for a list of up to date environment variables. You will need to create a new .env file on the root level to match the variables in the example file.

# Testing

 Jest library used in tandem with React Testing Library is sufficient to perform meaningful unit tests for our application, allowing near full test coverage.

# Installation Instructions

`yarn install` or `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies locally.

## Other Scripts
    * start - sets up the development environment and starts a server
    * test - runs tests found within the full application (*.test.js file extensions)
    * build - creates a 'build' directory with the production build of the app
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
